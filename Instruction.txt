General idea of how it works:
You build the main microphone relayer and run it. Once ran, it'll run silently without triggering basic AVs. When you run it, a discord bot will join the voice channel that you chose and start relaying audio.
There will also be a text channel from where you can change the audio device and shut off the relayer. There are 3 commands for the text channel which will be mentioned below.


Step 1: Building.

i. Download bomb.py, build_exe.bat, opus.dll file 
ii. In bomb.py file, replace line 36,37,38 with correct information
iii. In build_exe.bat file, replace line 10,11 with correct information.
iii. Get your icon file for the exe, make sure it is in .ico format
iv. Put all of the files in the same directory, run the build_exe.bat.
v. You will now get your final microphone relay app in the dist folder.

Step 2: Usage.

i. In your text control channel, use "!list" to see all audio devices.
ii. If you can't already hear anything, use "!change [audio device number]" to change audio devices.
iii. Once done, use "!close" to shut off the app and bot. 

Details:

i. Relays audio via voice channel in discord server.
ii. App can be controlled via text channel in discord server.
iii. You can change audio device, see list of all audio device, close the app through discord.
